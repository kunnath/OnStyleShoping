npm run dev
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `provider: ^6.1.2` - For state management

### Code Structure
- Cart models and provider at the top of `main.dart`
- Cart functionality integrated into existing product cards
- Separate `CartScreen` widget for dedicated cart view
- Backend routes in `routes/cart.js`
- Database models in `models/` directory

### Authentication
The backend cart routes are protected with JWT authentication middleware. In a production app, you would need to implement user authentication to fully utilize the cart persistence.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Features
- Modern Material Design 3 styling
- Responsive layout
- Loading states and error handling
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent with existing app design

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

The cart feature is now fully functional and ready for use! Users can add products, manage quantities, and proceed through the shopping flow.
