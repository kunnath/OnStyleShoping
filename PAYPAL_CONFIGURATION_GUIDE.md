# PayPal Integration Configuration Guide

## Overview
The Fashion Store app now includes a complete PayPal payment integration that allows users to authenticate with their PayPal account and complete payments directly through the PayPal interface.

## How PayPal Integration Works

### User Experience Flow
1. **Select PayPal Payment**: User selects PayPal as payment method during checkout
2. **PayPal Interface Opens**: App launches PayPal's secure checkout interface
3. **User Authentication**: User logs into their PayPal account or continues as guest
4. **Payment Confirmation**: User reviews and confirms payment details
5. **Transaction Complete**: App receives confirmation and completes the order

### Technical Implementation
The app uses the `flutter_paypal_payment` package to provide:
- Secure PayPal authentication
- Real-time payment processing
- Transaction status callbacks
- Error handling and user feedback

## PayPal Developer Account Setup

### Step 1: Create PayPal Developer Account
1. Go to [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Sign up for a developer account or log in with existing PayPal account
3. Navigate to "My Apps & Credentials"

### Step 2: Create New Application
1. Click "Create App"
2. Choose app name (e.g., "Fashion Store App")
3. Select merchant account for live payments
4. Choose "Default Application" for features
5. Click "Create App"

### Step 3: Get API Credentials
After creating the app, you'll see:
- **Client ID**: Used for API authentication
- **Client Secret**: Used for secure server-side operations

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Replace Demo Credentials
In `lib/main.dart`, find the `_processPayPalPayment()` method and replace:

```dart
// Replace these demo credentials with your actual PayPal credentials
clientId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID", 
secretKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY",
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

#### For Development/Testing (Sandbox)
```dart
sandboxMode: true, // Keep as true for testing
```

#### For Production
```dart
sandboxMode: false, // Set to false for live payments
```

### Step 3: Payment Configuration
The current implementation includes:
- **Currency**: USD (can be changed to other supported currencies)
- **Items**: Automatic cart item listing
- **Shipping**: $5.99 (configurable)
- **Tax Calculation**: Currently not implemented (can be added)

## PayPal Sandbox Testing

### Step 1: Create Test Accounts
1. In PayPal Developer Portal, go to "Sandbox Accounts"
2. Create test buyer account with email/password
3. Add test funds to buyer account

### Step 2: Test Payment Flow
1. Run the app in debug mode
2. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout
3. Select PayPal payment method
4. Use sandbox buyer credentials to complete test payment

### Step 3: Verify Transactions
- Check PayPal Developer Dashboard for transaction logs
- Monitor app console for success/error callbacks

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom Payment Details
You can customize payment details by modifying the transaction object:

```dart
transactions: [
  {
    "amount": {
      "total": totalAmount.toStringAsFixed(2),
      "currency": "USD", // Change currency here
      "details": {
        "subtotal": subtotalAmount.toStringAsFixed(2),
        "shipping": shippingAmount.toStringAsFixed(2),
        "tax": taxAmount.toStringAsFixed(2), // Add tax calculation
        "shipping_discount": discountAmount.toStringAsFixed(2)
      }
    },
    "description": "Fashion Store Purchase - ${widget.cartItems.length} items",
    // Add more custom fields as needed
  }
]
```

### Payment Success Handling
The app handles successful payments by:
1. Creating a PaymentMethod object with transaction ID
2. Updating checkout state
3. Showing success message with transaction details
4. Proceeding to order confirmation

### Error Handling
Built-in error handling includes:
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Transaction declines
- User cancellation

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management
- **Never commit real credentials to version control**
- Use environment variables or secure configuration files
- Consider using Flutter's build-time variables

### 2. Transaction Verification
- Implement server-side transaction verification
- Store transaction IDs for reconciliation
- Set up webhook notifications for payment status updates

### 3. User Data Protection
- PayPal handles sensitive payment data (PCI compliant)
- App only receives transaction confirmation
- No credit card data stored locally

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Replace sandbox credentials with live PayPal credentials
- [ ] Set `sandboxMode: false`
- [ ] Test with small real transactions
- [ ] Implement proper error logging
- [ ] Set up transaction monitoring
- [ ] Configure webhook endpoints for payment notifications
- [ ] Test refund/return processes

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Monitor transaction success rates
- [ ] Track payment-related user feedback
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup transaction logs

## Supported Features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Client ID not found" Error
- Verify Client ID is correctly copied from PayPal Developer Portal
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters
- Check if using sandbox vs live credentials correctly

#### 2. Payment Interface Not Loading
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify PayPal service status
- Ensure correct sandbox/live mode setting

#### 3. Transaction Fails After Authentication

- Verify amount calculations are correct
- Ensure shipping address format is valid

#### 4. Success Callback Not Triggered
- Check for JavaScript errors in PayPal interface
- Verify callback URL configuration
- Monitor network requests for API responses

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by:
1. Setting Flutter debug mode
2. Monitoring console output for PayPal-specific logs
3. Using PayPal Developer Dashboard transaction logs
